import { PackageInstall } from 'renoun/components'

Render a package install command with a variant for `npm`, `pnpm`, `bun` and `yarn`.

<Preview>
  <PackageInstall packages={['renoun']} />
</Preview>

## Configuration

The `PackageInstall` component uses local storage for the package manager preference, so it is important to ensure that the component is renders on the client without any flashing from state changes.

This can be avoided by rendering the `PackageInstallScript` in your root component or layout file before rendering `PackageInstall`:

```tsx path="layout.tsx"
import { PackageInstallScript } from 'renoun/components'

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        <PackageInstallScript />
        {children}
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

<Note>

A banner with an error will be added to the page during development if the
`PackageInstallScript` is not loaded on the client side.
