## Rendering images from Figma

The `Image` component can fetch frames and components directly from Figma. It behaves like a regular `<img />` element but accepts additional paths such as a [configured source](#1-configure-supported-files) (e.g. `icons:arrow-up`), the default `figma:` source, or a full Figma URL.

When rendering Figma components the description from the file is automatically used for the `<img />` accessibility text. You can override it by passing a `description` prop.

### 1. Create a Figma access token

In the Figma app, go to Main menu → Help and account → Account settings → Security → Personal access tokens. Click "Generate new token" and copy it. The token must include the following scopes:

- `file_content:read` (required for exporting images and reading file content)
- `library_content:read` (required if you reference components by name or read published components)
- `team_library_content:read` (if components are published in team libraries)

Refer to the official docs: [Figma access tokens](https://www.figma.com/developers/api#access-tokens).

### 2. Configure the environment variable

Set the **`FIGMA_TOKEN`** environment variable in your hosting platform:

- **Vercel:** Project → Settings → Environment Variables
- **Vercel (CLI):** `vercel env add FIGMA_TOKEN` (use `vercel env pull .env.local` to sync locally)
- **Netlify:** Site configuration → Environment variables
- **Netlify (CLI):** `netlify env:set FIGMA_TOKEN YOUR_TOKEN`
- **Amplify:** App settings → Environment variables
- **Other:** Refer to your hosting provider documentation.

For local development, create a `.env.local` file at the project root with:

```bash
FIGMA_TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN
```

Restart your dev server so the change is picked up.

### 3. Configure supported files

Define custom sources on `RootProvider` to declare which Figma files are allowed. Each source entry is explicitly typed and future‑proof:

```tsx
import { RootProvider } from 'renoun'

export default function Layout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <RootProvider
      sources={{
        icons: {
          type: 'figma',
          fileId: 'KsxgdfVdV3fEQ0oz0CMNeg',
        },
        illustration: {
          type: 'figma',
          fileId: 'DxgdfDdVsd3fEQ0oQz0CMNeg',
          basePathname: 'illustration',
        },
      }}
    >
      {children}
    </RootProvider>
  )
}
```

You can reference your assets by using the registered source directly (e.g. `icons:arrow-up` or `illustration:marketing`). The built‑in `figma:` scheme and direct Figma URLs are also supported for convenience.

### Usage

```tsx
import { Image } from 'renoun'

export function NodeId() {
  return (
    <Image
      description="renoun logo mark"
      width={128}
      height={128}
      source="figma:563:1297"
    />
  )
}
```

You can also paste the entire share link copied from Figma:

```tsx
import { Image } from 'renoun'

export function Link() {
  return (
    <Image source="https://www.figma.com/design/KsxgdfDdV3fEQ0oQz0CMNeg/renoun-design-system-template?node-id=563-1297" />
  )
}
```

When using the default `figma:` source or a custom source, you can reference components by their name rather than the node id. For example, the following will resolve to the `arrow-down` component inside the `icons` source configured on the `RootProvider`:

```tsx
import { Image } from 'renoun'

export function ComponentName() {
  return (
    <>
      <Image source="figma:icons/arrow-down" />
      <Image source="icons:arrow-down" />
    </>
  )
}
```

You can also include a raw Figma file ID directly in the `figma:` source instead of an alias:

```tsx
import { Image } from 'renoun'

export function FrameId() {
  return <Image source="figma:KsxguDdVW4EQ0oQz0CMNeg/915:1075" />
}
```

<Note>

When using component names, renoun first queries Figma's Components API. If no match is returned, it falls back to scanning the file document to locate the component by name, which can be slightly slower. For the best performance, use a numeric node id (e.g. `915:1075`). Make sure your token has `file_content:read` and, if referencing published components, `library_content:read` (and `team_library_content:read` for team libraries).

</Note>

### Additional options

Pass export options directly to the component when using Figma sources:

```tsx
import { Image } from 'renoun'

export function ExportOptions() {
  return (
    <Image
      source="figma:illustrations/1203:880"
      description="Full color illustration"
      format="svg"
      useAbsoluteBounds
    />
  )
}
```
