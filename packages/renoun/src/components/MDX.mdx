## Security

This component evaluates JavaScript. Always sanitize user-provided content before passing it to the `MDX` component. This includes sanitizing `value`, `components`, and `dependencies`.

Failing to do so puts you at risk of a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. See the [MDX security documentation](https://mdxjs.com/getting-started#security) for more information.

Prefer the [`Markdown` component](https://renoun.dev/components/markdown) if possible for rendering untrusted content as it does not evaluate JavaScript and is therefore safe by default.
