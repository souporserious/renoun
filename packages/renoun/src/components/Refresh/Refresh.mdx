Add the `Refresh` component to the root layout of your application to enable hot module replacement when a source file changes:

```tsx
import { Refresh } from 'renoun/components'

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        {children}
        <Refresh />
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

<Note>

This requires the `renoun` server to be running during development:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "renoun next dev"
  }
}
```

</Note>

This component only subscribes to the `renoun` server during development and will return `null` in production.
