## Rendering GitHub Sponsors

This component **requires a GitHub Personal Access Token** to fetch your sponsors from the GitHub GraphQL API. It runs only on the server and the token is never exposed to the client.

### 1. Create a token

Use a **Personal Access Token (classic)** with the required scope of `read:user`. You can create a token here: https://github.com/settings/tokens/new.

### 2. Add the environment variable

Configure the **`GITHUB_SPONSORS_TOKEN`** environment variable in your hosting provider:

- **Vercel:** Project → Settings → Environment Variables
- **Netlify:** Site configuration → Environment variables
- **Amplify:** App settings → Environment variables
- **Other:** See the documentation for your hosting provider.
