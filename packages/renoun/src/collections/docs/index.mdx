Collections are a way to organize and query file-system data in renoun. They are a powerful tool that allows you to define a schema for file exports and query those exports using a simple API.

## Creating a Collection

Let's walk through an example of creating a collection for a blog. We'll define a `PostsCollection` that targets all MDX files within the posts directory using the `filePattern` field that accepts a [minimatch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/minimatch) pattern:

```ts filename="01.collections.ts"
import { Collection } from 'renoun/collections'

export const PostsCollection = new Collection({
  filePattern: 'posts/*.mdx',
})
```

<Note>

When creating a new collection for the first time, a dynamic import will be
generated at the collection's call site for each targeted extension during the development and build
process. These imports are necessary to load the targeted files from
the file system.

```ts highlightedLines="5"
import { Collection } from 'renoun/collections'

export const PostsCollection = new Collection(
  { filePattern: 'posts/*.mdx' },
  (slug) => import(`./posts/${slug}.mdx`)
)
```

</Note>

## Configuring Collections

You can specify a `baseDirectory` to trim the beginning of the generated path up to that point, and a `basePath` to define a prefix added to the generated path.

```ts filename="02.collections.ts"
import { Collection } from 'renoun/collections'

export const PostsCollection = new Collection({
  filePattern: 'posts/*.mdx',
  baseDirectory: 'posts',
  basePath: 'posts',
})
```

## Adding Types

To define the shape of the file exports, you can pass a generic type to the `Collection` constructor. This type will be used to type-check the exports of the files in the collection.

Since we're working with MDX, we can use the `MDXContent` type from the `renoun/mdx` package to define the shape of the default export. We'll also add types for the `frontmatter` export we expect to be defined in the MDX files:

```ts filename="collections.ts"
import { Collection, type FileSystemSource } from 'renoun/collections'
import type { MDXContent } from 'renoun/mdx'

interface PostsSchema {
  default: MDXContent
  frontmatter: {
    title: string
    description: string
  }
}

export const PostsCollection = new Collection<PostsSchema>({
  filePattern: 'posts/*.mdx',
  baseDirectory: 'posts',
  basePath: 'posts',
})
```

This will ensure that the `default` export of each MDX file in the `posts` directory is of type `MDXContent`, and that the `frontmatter` export is an object with `title` and `description` properties.

## Adding a Schema

While types are useful for type-checking, you can also define a schema for the collection. A schema is a set of rules that define the structure of the file exports and provide useful error handling.

You can use the `schema` field to define a schema for the expected file exports in a collection. Using a library like [Zod](https://zod.dev/) can help you define schemas in a type-safe way:

```ts
import { Collection } from 'renoun/collections'
import type { MDXContent } from 'renoun/mdx'
import { z } from 'zod'

const frontmatterSchema = z.object({
  title: z.string(),
  description: z.string(),
})

interface PostsSchema {
  default: MDXContent
  frontmatter: z.infer<typeof frontmatterSchema>
}

export const PostsCollection = new Collection<PostsSchema>({
  filePattern: 'posts/*.mdx',
  baseDirectory: 'posts',
  basePath: 'posts',
  schema: {
    frontmatter: frontmatterSchema.parse,
  },
})
```

Now we'll validate the front matter of each MDX file in the `posts` directory using the `frontmatterSchema`. This ensures that each file adheres to the schema and provides type safety when accessing the front matter.

See the [Zod](/guides/zod) and [Valibot](/guides/valibot) guides for more information on how to use schemas with collections.

## Querying Sources

Once you've configured your collections, you can query the targeted files using the `getSource` and `getSources` methods. These methods return `Source` instances that represent a single file or directory in the collection.

To start, we'll generate a set of navigation links for all of the posts in the `PostsCollection` using the `getSources` method. Each `Source` has additional helper methods, such as `getPath` that returns a URL-friendly path of the source relative to the collection's base directory:

```tsx filename="posts/index.tsx"
import { PostsCollection } from '../collections'

export default async function Posts() {
  const sources = await PostsCollection.getSources()

  return (
    <ul>
      {sources.map((source) => (
        <li key={source.getPath()}>
          <a href={source.getPath()}>{source.getName()}</a>
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  )
}
```

We can now generate a page for individual posts using a `slug` parameter to retrieve the source for a specific MDX file in the `posts` directory:

```tsx filename="posts/post.tsx"
import { PostsCollection } from '../collections'

export default async function Post({
  params,
}: {
  params: Promise<{ slug: string }>
}) {
  const post = await PostsCollection.getSource((await params).slug)

  if (!post) {
    return <div>Post not found</div>
  }

  const Content = await post.getExport('default').getValue()

  return <Content />
}
```

This was a simple example of how to query and render the contents of MDX files using collections. Collections are not limited to MDX files and can be used with _any file type_ your bundler is capable of importing.

## Composite Collections

In addition to creating individual collections, renoun also allows you to define **composite collections**. A composite collection is a combination of multiple collections, allowing you to treat them as a single entity. This can be useful when you want to query across different directories or file patterns while maintaining a unified interface.

### Creating a Composite Collection

Let's say you have two collections, one for blog posts, and another for components. Using a composite collection, you can combine these into a single collection that can be queried as if it were one:

```tsx
import { Collection, CompositeCollection } from 'renoun/collections'

const PostsCollection = new Collection({
  filePattern: 'posts/*.mdx',
  baseDirectory: 'posts',
})

const ComponentsCollection = new Collection({
  filePattern: 'src/components/**/*.{ts,tsx}',
  baseDirectory: 'components',
})

const AllCollections = new CompositeCollection(
  PostsCollection,
  ComponentsCollection
)
```

With this setup, `AllCollections` allows you to query across both `PostsCollection` and `ComponentsCollection` seamlessly.

### Querying Across Collections

When retrieving a source and querying for siblings, composite collections will account for all sources across the collections it comprises:

```tsx allowErrors
const source = AllCollections.getSource(
  'posts/how-to-build-a-button-component'
)!
const [previousSource, nextSource] = await source.getSiblings()
```

Here, `source.getSiblings()` will return the sources from both `PostsCollection` and `ComponentsCollection` as a combined set.

### Narrowing Source Types

Collections provide a type guard to check if a source belongs to a specific collection within a composite collection. You can use the `<Collection>.hasSource` method to safely narrow the type of a source when working with composite collections:

```tsx allowErrors
if (ComponentsCollection.hasSource(nextSource)) {
  // nextSource is now typed as a ComponentsCollection source
}
```

This type guard ensures that you’re working with the correct source type within a composite collection, allowing you to access schema-specific exports.

## Conclusion

Collections can be used to generate static pages, create navigations, site maps and much more. At their core, they abstract files and directories into either a `CollectionSource`, `FileSystemSource`, or `ExportSource` allowing you to analyze and render them programmatically.
