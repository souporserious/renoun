  tags: ['waku', 'framework'],
}

The renoun toolkit enhances [Waku](https://waku.gg/) by providing features like [file system utilities](/utilities/file-system), [syntax highlighting](/components/code-block), and [type documentation](/components/reference), making it easier to create accurate and engaging content for blogs, documentation, and design systems.

## Install

To use renoun with Waku, youâ€™ll need a Waku project. If you don't have a project yet, you can create one using Waku's `npm create waku` command:

```bash
npm create waku@latest
```

Now in your Waku project, let's install renoun:

<Command variant="install">renoun</Command>

## Setup

Modify the `waku` scripts located in the `package.json` file to integrate renoun into your Waku project. This ensures the renoun process starts alongside your Waku server, enabling the full functionality of renoun:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "renoun waku dev",
    "build": "renoun waku build"
  }
}
```

<Note>

The `renoun` CLI needs to be part of the `dev` and `build` scripts to ensure
features like the File System utilities and syntax highlighting work in your Waku app.

</Note>

## Start

Now you can start your Waku server with renoun integrated:

<Command variant="run">dev</Command>

Congratulations, you've successfully set up renoun with Waku! You can now query other [file system](/utilities/file-system) entries or use one of the many [components](/components) available to enhance your content and documentation.
