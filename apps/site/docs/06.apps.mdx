    'Run renoun apps and templates from node_modules by shadowing files from your local project.',
}

Running a **renoun app** lets you start from an app that lives in `node_modules`—like
`@renoun/blog`, `@renoun/docs`, or a Presenter-style app—and override it with files in your own
repo.

This is what `renoun dev` / `renoun build` / `renoun start` do:

- The renoun app (template or full application) is the **root app**.
- Your files **shadow** the app’s files.
- Renoun builds a runtime under `.renoun/`, merges both views, and launches the framework there.

> If you already have your own Next/Vite/Waku app and just want renoun inside it, use  
> **“Use renoun in your app”** (`renoun next dev`, `renoun vite dev`, etc.) instead.

## How it works

When you run `renoun dev`, the CLI orchestrates the following process:

```text
Your Project
├── package.json
├── posts/                      ← your content (shadows the `@renoun/blog` app)
│   └── hello-world.mdx
└── .renoun/                    ← renoun-managed runtime directory
    └── @blog/                  ← `@renoun/blog` app + your shadowed files merged
        ├── app/                ← copied from the `@renoun/blog` app
        ├── posts/              ← symlink → your posts/
        └── node_modules/       ← symlink → `@renoun/blog` dependencies
```

1. **Runtime preparation**
   The CLI creates `.renoun/<app-name>` and copies the renoun app’s source files
   (TypeScript, config, etc.) into it. Non-source files and `node_modules` are symlinked to avoid
   duplication.

2. **Shadow application**
   Any files or directories you’ve created that match paths in the app are symlinked from the
   runtime to your local versions, effectively **shadowing** the renoun app.

3. **Framework launch**
   The CLI spawns the framework (`next dev`, `vite dev`, `waku dev`, etc.) **inside the runtime
   directory**. The framework sees a merged view: app code plus your overrides.

4. **Path resolution**
   Renoun sets an internal environment variable so its utilities resolve paths relative to the
   runtime directory, ensuring your shadowed content is discovered correctly.

This architecture means you never modify the renoun app in `node_modules`; you only add and edit
files in your own project.

---

## Quick start

1. Install the renoun runtime and a renoun app (template or full app):

   ```bash
   pnpm add renoun @renoun/blog
   ```

2. Add scripts that call into the renoun CLI:

   ```json
   {
     "scripts": {
       "dev": "renoun dev",
       "build": "renoun build"
     }
   }
   ```

3. Create any files you want to shadow from the app, for example:

   ```text
   posts/hello-world.mdx
   ```

4. Run the renoun app:

   ```bash
   pnpm run dev
   ```

   See [`examples/app`](https://github.com/souporserious/renoun/tree/main/examples/app)
   for a workspace demo that follows this setup and shadows the `posts/` directory from the
   `@renoun/blog` app.

The CLI copies the app into `.renoun/<package-name>` inside your project, replaces any paths
that you shadow with symlinks to your local files, and then executes the app’s framework command
(`next dev`, `vite dev`, or `waku dev`). The framework output appears in your terminal just like
running the app directly.

## Shadowing behavior

Every file or directory that you place next to your `package.json`—excluding lockfiles and
`node_modules`—is eligible to shadow the renoun app. During startup renoun:

1. **Copies source files** (`.ts`, `.tsx`, `.js`, etc.) from the app into the runtime directory.
   Source files are copied rather than symlinked so that bundlers resolve imports relative to the
   runtime, not the original package location.

2. **Symlinks non-source files** (images, stylesheets, configs) and `node_modules` to avoid
   duplication and keep the runtime lightweight.

3. **Applies shadows** by replacing any matching paths with symlinks to your local files. If you
   shadow a directory (like `posts/`), the entire app directory is replaced with a symlink
   to yours.

4. **Enables hot reload** because the framework watches the symlinked files, so edits to your
   source files trigger rebuilds immediately.

This lets you focus on content and targeted overrides. For example, to replace a component shipped
with the app, add a new file with the same relative path:

```tsx
// ui/RootProvider.tsx
import {
  RootProvider as BaseRootProvider,
  type RootProviderProps,
} from 'renoun'

export function RootProvider(props: RootProviderProps) {
  return <BaseRootProvider {...props} theme="nord" />
}
```

The runtime symlink points to your implementation, so the framework reloads with your changes
without extra configuration. When you shadow a directory (for example `posts/`), the entire app
directory is replaced by your version, letting you remove or rename the app’s defaults without
editing anything in `node_modules`.

## Ejecting a renoun app

Running a renoun app from `node_modules` is great for exploring and making light customizations.
When you’re ready to **fully own the app’s source**, you can **eject**.

Ejecting turns:

> “Run a renoun app from `node_modules`”
> into
> “Use renoun in _your_ app.”

### What `renoun eject` does

When you run:

```bash
renoun eject
```

renoun will:

1. **Materialize the runtime into your repo**
   - Take the current runtime at `.renoun/<app-name>`.
   - Copy its application files (e.g. `app/`, `components/`, `ui/`, configs) into your project
     root (or a configured target directory).
   - Preserve paths so the app layout matches what you were already running.

2. **Apply your shadows on top**
   - Any files or directories you were shadowing (like `posts/` or `ui/RootProvider.tsx`) are
     treated as the source of truth.
   - If a file exists both in the runtime and your project, the **local file wins**.
   - Shadowed directories fully replace the app’s version.

   The result is a single, coherent codebase in your project that reflects exactly what you were
   seeing while running the renoun app.

3. **Remove the renoun app dependency**
   - The ejected app no longer depends on the original renoun app package at runtime.
   - `renoun eject` removes the specified app from your `dependencies` / `devDependencies`,
     leaving `renoun` itself in place.

4. **Prepare you to run it as your own app**

   After ejecting, your app lives directly in your repo. You can switch to running it like any
   other framework app with renoun:

   ```json
   {
     "scripts": {
       "dev": "renoun next dev",
       "build": "renoun next build"
     }
   }
   ```

   (Swap `next` for `vite` / `waku` depending on the framework the app uses.)

Now you’re using the “Use renoun in your app” flow, with the ejected codebase as _your_ app.

### When to eject

Stay in the **“run a renoun app”** flow (`renoun dev`) when:

- You want to try a blog/docs/Presenter app quickly.
- You’re happy with the overall structure and only need targeted overrides.
- You want to keep upgrading the underlying app over time.

Use **`renoun eject`** when:

- You’re turning the app into a long-lived product with heavy customizations.
- You want full control over routing, layout, configuration, and dependencies.
- You’re ready to treat it as your app and run it via `renoun next dev` / `renoun vite dev` /
  `renoun waku dev`.

---

## Cleaning up

Stop the process with `Ctrl+C` just like any framework script. The next run recreates the runtime
folder from scratch, ensuring you always start from a clean copy of the renoun app when using
`renoun dev`.

After ejecting, the `.renoun/` directory is still used for caches and internal state, but the
ejected app no longer depends on the app runtime in `node_modules`.

## Security model

Running renoun apps this way is designed with security in mind. Here's how the system protects your
project:

### What renoun controls

The CLI uses an internal environment variable (`RENOUN_RUNTIME_DIRECTORY`) to tell renoun utilities
where the runtime directory is. This allows file discovery to work correctly in the merged
environment. Before trusting this variable, renoun validates it with multiple checks:

| Check                        | What it prevents                                                                                          |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Real path resolution**     | Follows symlinks and resolves `../` before validation, preventing path traversal attacks                  |
| **Containment verification** | The resolved path must contain `/.renoun/`, ensuring it's a renoun-managed directory                      |
| **Workspace validation**     | The parent directory must contain `package.json` or `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, confirming it's a real project |

If any check fails, renoun ignores the environment variable and falls back to normal path
resolution. This means even if an attacker sets the variable, they can't redirect renoun to
arbitrary directories.

### What you control

While renoun secures its internal operations, you should understand these aspects of the system:

- **Renoun apps run code in your environment.** Only install templates or applications from
  sources you trust, just as you would with any npm dependency. Renoun apps have the same access
  as any other package in your project.

- **The `.renoun/` directory is temporary.** Add it to your `.gitignore`. It's recreated fresh on
  each run, so don't store anything important there.

- **Symlinks point to your real files.** When you shadow a file, the framework reads directly from
  your source. This is the intended behavior—it enables hot reload and live editing.

### Shared environments

If you're running renoun in a shared server or CI environment where other processes might set
environment variables before the CLI starts, be aware that environment variable injection is a
general security concern for any application. Renoun's validation mitigates this for its specific
use case, but standard environment isolation practices still apply.

### Summary

Running a renoun app from `node_modules` via `renoun dev` is safe for normal development
workflows. The security model ensures renoun only operates within your project's `.renoun/`
directory, and the same trust model applies to renoun apps as to any npm package you install.
If you eject, you keep all the code locally and continue building as your own app with the same
safety guarantees.
