This guide will help you get started using renoun in your project. Designed as a powerful toolkit for building documentation and authoring content with MDX, renoun offers a suite of utilities and components to create beautiful, interactive documentation tailored exactly to your needs.

While this getting-started guide uses [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) as an example, renoun works with any framework or bundler that supports React Server Components.

## Installation

First, install renoun and additionally set up a Next.js project if you haven't already:

<PackageInstall packages={['renoun']} />

## Configuration

### CLI

A CLI is included with renoun to help isolate the processing required for syntax highlighting and resolving type information. This greatly improves performance of these operations by keeping them separate from your application's development and build processes.

To use the CLI, prepend `renoun` to your Next.js `dev` and `build` commands in your project's `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "renoun next dev",
    "build": "renoun next build"
  }
}
```

Then start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Prepending the renoun CLI ensures that the renoun process starts before your framework's server. The CLI starts a WebSocket server that will watch for changes to the file system and communicates with renoun components and utilities.

## MDX Content

The renoun toolkit helps with authoring MDX using the `renoun/mdx` package, allowing you to write content with a mix of Markdown and React components. The `renoun/mdx` package is not required to use, but provides a set of [useful plugins](/guides/mdx#pre-configured-plugins) to enhance your content.

To start, create a new directory in your project called `posts` and add a new file called `build-a-button-component-in-react.mdx`:

<Note>

If you already have a directory of MDX files, you can [skip to the next step](#querying-the-file-system). The `posts` directory is just an example and can be named anything you like.

</Note>

````mdx path="build-a-button-component-in-react.mdx"
export const metadata = {
  title: 'Build a Button Component in React',
  description: `Learn how to build a reusable Button component in React that can be used across your application.`,
  date: '2025-06-07',
  tags: ['react', 'design systems'],
}

In modern web development, creating reusable UI components is a must for efficiency and scalability. React, with its component-based architecture, allows developers to build encapsulated components that manage their own state and can be reused throughout applications.

## Building the Button Component

Let's start by creating our Button component:

```tsx
import React from 'react'

export function Button({ label, onClick, className }) {
  return (
    <button className={className} onClick={onClick}>
      {label}
    </button>
  )
}
```
````

We are using [YAML front matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/) to define metadata for the post, such as the `title`, `date`, `summary`, and `tags`. This metadata can be used to show a list of posts, filter by tags, or display the post's title and date.

## Querying the File System

The `Directory` class is a core utility in renoun. This allows you to easily query and render files and directories within a file system. To create a list of blog posts, query all of the MDX files in the `posts` directory we created in the previous step:

```tsx
import { Directory } from 'renoun/file-system'

const posts = new Directory({
  path: 'posts',
  include: '*.mdx',
})
```

Now we can use the configured directory to render the contents of our MDX files by querying them from the file system.

Create a new file in the `app/posts` directory called `[slug].tsx` and add the following:

```tsx
import { Directory } from 'renoun/file-system'

const posts = new Directory({
  path: 'posts',
  include: '*.mdx',
})

export default async function Page({
  params,
}: {
  params: Promise<{ slug: string }>
}) {
  const slug = (await params).slug
  const post = await posts.getFile(slug, 'mdx')
  const Content = await post.getExportValue('default')

  return <Content />
}
```

This will create a collection of every MDX file in the `posts` directory and render the page based on the provided slug.

### Loaders

By default, the `Directory` class will load files using the MDX compiler. However, if you are using a bundler like Webpack, Turbopack, or Vite, it is recommended to define a loader that resolves the module. This is especially useful for MDX files, which are often processed by the bundler's loader.

Use the `loader` option in the `Directory` constructor to assign a specific loader for each file type. In the `posts` directory, for instance, you can use a dynamic import as the loader to ensure that the MDX files are processed by the bundler:

```tsx highlightedLines="6-8"
import { Directory } from 'renoun/file-system'

const posts = new Directory({
  path: 'posts',
  include: '*.mdx',
  loader: {
    mdx: (path) => import(`./posts/${path}.mdx`),
  },
})
```

<Note>

Ensure that your bundler is configured to handle the file extension you are targeting. Next.js requires [custom configuration](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/mdx) to handle `.mdx` files.

</Note>

### Generating Links

A [File System](/utilities/file-system) entry's `getPath` method is used to generate a route path for each entry in the directory. To generate a link to each post, map over the directory's entries using `getEntries` and then use the entry's `getPath` method to generate a list of links:

```tsx
import { Directory } from 'renoun/file-system'
import Link from 'next/link'

const posts = new Directory({
  path: 'posts',
  include: '*.mdx',
  loader: {
    mdx: (path) => import(`@/posts/${path}.mdx`),
  },
})

export default async function Page() {
  const allPosts = await posts.getEntries()

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Blog</h1>
      <ul>
        {allPosts.map((post) => {
          const pathname = post.getPathname()

          return (
            <li key={pathname}>
              <Link href={pathname}>{post.getTitle()}</Link>
            </li>
          )
        })}
      </ul>
    </>
  )
}
```

<Note>

The `getEntries` method is filtered by the `include` option provided to the `Directory` constructor. This will only return entries that match the provided glob pattern. Alternatively, you can pass a function to `include` to filter entries based on custom logic.

</Note>

## Validating Exports

Alongside file loading, renoun can validate module exports to ensure that source code is documented and exported according to a consistent schema. This is especially beneficial in larger projects where multiple developers collaborate on the same codebase.

Below is an example demonstrating how to validate a `metadata` object exported from a module using [Zod](https://zod.dev/):

```tsx path="posts.ts"
import { Directory, withSchema } from 'renoun/file-system'
import { z } from 'zod'

export const posts = new Directory({
  path: 'posts',
  include: '*.mdx',
  loader: {
    mdx: withSchema(
      {
        metadata: {
          title: z.string(),
          date: z.coerce.date(),
          summary: z.string().optional(),
          tags: z.array(z.string()).optional(),
        },
      },
      (path) => import(`./posts/${path}.mdx`)
    ),
  },
})
```

Here we define a schema for the front matter of our MDX files and use it to validate each file in the `posts` directory. This ensures that each file adheres to the schema and provides type safety when accessing the `metadata` export:

```tsx
import { posts } from './posts.ts'

const post = await posts.getFile('build-a-button-component-in-react.mdx')
const metadata = await post.getExportValue('metadata')
const { title, date, summary, tags } = metadata
```

### Metadata

Now that we have a schema for the metadata, we can access it from the MDX file using the `getExportValue` method:

```tsx highlightedLines="10-12,15-17"
import { Directory, withSchema } from 'renoun/file-system'
import { z } from 'zod'

export const posts = new Directory({
  path: 'posts',
  include: '*.mdx',
  loader: {
    mdx: withSchema(
      {
        metadata: {
          title: z.string(),
          date: z.coerce.date(),
          summary: z.string().optional(),
          tags: z.array(z.string()).optional(),
        },
      },
      (path) => import(`./posts/${path}.mdx`)
    ),
  },
})

export default async function Page({
  params,
}: {
  params: Promise<{ slug: string }>
}) {
  const slug = (await params).slug
  const post = await posts.getFile(slug, 'mdx')
  const metadata = await post.getExportValue('metadata')
  const Content = await post.getExportValue('default')

  return (
    <>
      <h1>{metadata.title}</h1>
      <p>{metadata.description}</p>
      <Content />
    </>
  )
}
```

If you are using front matter, you can use the [remark-frontmatter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/remark-frontmatter) and [remark-mdx-frontmatter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/remark-mdx-frontmatter) packages to parse the front matter and export it as a JavaScript object.

## Enhancing with Components

The renoun toolkit provides several built-in components to enhance your documentation like [`APIReference`](/components/api-reference) and [`CodeBlock`](/components/code-block). For example, you can use the `APIReference` component to document all exports from a module:

```mdx
import { APIReference } from 'renoun/components'

<APIReference source="components/Card.tsx" />
```

<Preview>
  <APIReference source="components/Card.tsx" />
</Preview>
