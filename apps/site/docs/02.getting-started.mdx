This guide will help you get started using renoun in your project. Designed as a powerful toolkit for building documentation and authoring content with MDX, renoun offers a suite of utilities and components to create beautiful, interactive documentation tailored exactly to your needs.

While this getting-started guide uses [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) as an example, renoun works with any framework or bundler that supports React Server Components.

## Installation

First, install renoun and additionally set up a Next.js project if you haven't already:

<Command variant="install">renoun</Command>

## Configuration

### CLI

The renoun CLI keeps syntax highlighting and type analysis tasks in a background process while your React framework handles rendering. Once you install renoun you can run any command by prefixing it with `renoun`, for example `renoun next dev`.

Refer to the [CLI guide](/docs/cli) for an overview of the framework shims, additional flags, and utilities like theme pruning.

## MDX Content

The renoun toolkit helps with authoring MDX using the `@renoun/mdx` package which is automatically installed with renoun, allowing you to write content with a mix of Markdown and React components. The `@renoun/mdx` package is not required to use, but provides a set of [useful plugins](/guides/mdx#pre-configured-plugins) to enhance your content.

To start, create a new directory in your project called `posts` and add a new file called `build-a-button-component-in-react.mdx`:

<Note>

If you already have a directory of MDX files, you can [skip to the next step](#querying-the-file-system). The `posts` directory is just an example and can be named anything you like.

</Note>

````mdx path="build-a-button-component-in-react.mdx"
export const metadata = {
  title: 'Build a Button Component in React',
  description: `Learn how to build a reusable Button component in React that can be used across your application.`,
  date: '2025-06-07',
  tags: ['react', 'design systems'],
}

In modern web development, creating reusable UI components is a must for efficiency and scalability. React, with its component-based architecture, allows developers to build encapsulated components that manage their own state and can be reused throughout applications.

## Building the Button Component

Let's start by creating our Button component:

```tsx
import React from 'react'

export function Button({ label, onClick, className }) {
  return (
    <button className={className} onClick={onClick}>
      {label}
    </button>
  )
}
```
````

Notice we define and export a metadata object for the post. This metadata can be used to show a list of posts, filter by tags, or display the post's title and date.

## Querying the File System

The `Directory` class is a core utility in renoun. This allows you to easily query and render files and directories within a file system. To create a list of blog posts, query all of the MDX files in the `posts` directory we created in the previous step:

```tsx
import { Directory } from 'renoun'

const posts = new Directory({
  path: 'posts',
  filter: '*.mdx',
})
```

Now we can use the configured directory to render the contents of our MDX files by querying them from the file system.

Create a new file in the `app/posts` directory called `[slug].tsx` and add the following:

```tsx
import { Directory } from 'renoun'

const posts = new Directory({
  path: 'posts',
  filter: '*.mdx',
})

export default async function Page({
  params,
}: {
  params: Promise<{ slug: string }>
}) {
  const slug = (await params).slug
  const post = await posts.getFile(slug, 'mdx')
  const Content = await post.getExportValue('default')

  return <Content />
}
```

This will create a collection of every MDX file in the `posts` directory and render the page based on the provided slug.

### Loaders

By default, the `Directory` class will load files using the MDX compiler. However, if you are using a bundler like Webpack, Turbopack, or Vite, it is recommended to define a loader that resolves the module. This is especially useful for MDX files, which are often processed by the bundler's loader.

Use the `loader` option in the `Directory` constructor to assign a specific loader for each file type. In the `posts` directory, for instance, you can use a dynamic import as the loader to ensure that the MDX files are processed by the bundler:

```tsx highlightedLines="6-8"
import { Directory } from 'renoun'

const posts = new Directory({
  path: 'posts',
  filter: '*.mdx',
  loader: {
    mdx: (path) => import(`./posts/${path}.mdx`),
  },
})
```

<Note>

Ensure that your bundler is configured to handle the file extension you are targeting. Next.js requires [custom configuration](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/mdx) to handle `.mdx` files.

</Note>

### Generating Links

A [File System](/utilities/file-system) entry's `getPath` method is used to generate a route path for each entry in the directory. To generate a link to each post, map over the directory's entries using `getEntries` and then use the entry's `getPath` method to generate a list of links:

```tsx
import { Directory } from 'renoun'
import Link from 'next/link'

const posts = new Directory({
  path: 'posts',
  filter: '*.mdx',
  loader: {
    mdx: (path) => import(`@/posts/${path}.mdx`),
  },
})

export default async function Page() {
  const allPosts = await posts.getEntries()

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Blog</h1>
      <ul>
        {allPosts.map((post) => {
          const pathname = post.getPathname()

          return (
            <li key={pathname}>
              <Link href={pathname}>{post.title}</Link>
            </li>
          )
        })}
      </ul>
    </>
  )
}
```

<Note>

The `getEntries` method is filtered by the `filter` option provided to the `Directory` constructor. This will only return entries that match the provided glob pattern. Alternatively, you can pass a function to `filter` to filter entries based on custom logic.

</Note>

## Validating Exports

Alongside file loading, renoun can validate module exports to ensure that source code is documented and exported according to a consistent schema. This is especially beneficial in larger projects where multiple developers collaborate on the same codebase.

Below is an example demonstrating how to validate a `metadata` object exported from a module using [Zod](https://zod.dev/):

```ts path="posts.ts"
import { Directory } from 'renoun'
import { z } from 'zod'

export const posts = new Directory({
  path: 'posts',
  filter: '*.mdx',
  schema: {
    mdx: {
      metadata: z.object({
        title: z.string(),
        date: z.coerce.date(),
        summary: z.string().optional(),
        tags: z.array(z.string()).optional(),
      }),
    },
  },
  loader: {
    mdx: (path) => import(`./posts/${path}.mdx`),
  },
})
```

Here we define a schema for the front matter of our MDX files and use it to validate each file in the `posts` directory. This ensures that each file adheres to the schema and provides type safety when accessing the `metadata` export:

```tsx
import { posts } from './posts.ts'

const post = await posts.getFile('build-a-button-component-in-react.mdx')
const metadata = await post.getExportValue('metadata')
const { title, date, summary, tags } = metadata
```

### Metadata

Now that we have a schema for the metadata, we can access it from the MDX file using the `getExportValue` method:

```tsx highlightedLines="29-30"
import { Directory } from 'renoun'
import { z } from 'zod'

export const posts = new Directory({
  path: 'posts',
  filter: '*.mdx',
  schema: {
    mdx: {
      metadata: z.object({
        title: z.string(),
        date: z.coerce.date(),
        summary: z.string().optional(),
        tags: z.array(z.string()).optional(),
      }),
    },
  },
  loader: {
    mdx: (path) => import(`./posts/${path}.mdx`),
  },
})

export default async function Page({
  params,
}: {
  params: Promise<{ slug: string }>
}) {
  const slug = (await params).slug
  const post = await posts.getFile(slug, 'mdx')
  const metadata = await post.getExportValue('metadata')
  const Content = await post.getExportValue('default')

  return (
    <>
      <h1>{metadata.title.toString()}</h1>
      <p>{metadata.summary?.toString()}</p>
      <Content />
    </>
  )
}
```

If you are using front matter, you can use the [remark-frontmatter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/remark-frontmatter) and [remark-mdx-frontmatter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/remark-mdx-frontmatter) packages to parse the front matter and export it as a JavaScript object.

## Enhancing with Components

The renoun toolkit provides several built-in components to enhance your documentation like [`Reference`](/components/reference) and [`CodeBlock`](/components/code-block). For example, you can use the `Reference` component to document all exports from a module:

```mdx
import { Reference } from 'renoun'

<Reference source="components/Card.tsx" />
```
