Designed for building content and documentation sites, renoun is a versatile toolkit. This guide will help you set up renoun and start using it in your project.

## Installation

First, install renoun using your preferred package manager:

<PackageInstall packages={['renoun']} />

## Configuration

The renoun CLI can be used alongside your framework. For example, when using Next.js, prepend the CLI to your Next.js `dev` and `build` commands in your project's `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "renoun next dev",
    "build": "renoun next build"
  }
}
```

Then start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Prepending the renoun CLI ensures that the renoun process starts before your framework's server. The CLI starts a web socket server that will watch for changes to the file system and communicates with renoun components.

### Path Aliases

To simplify imports, you can optionally set up path aliases in your project's `tsconfig.json`:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["*"]
    }
  }
}
```

With this configuration, you can now import files using the `@/` alias which we will use in the following examples.

## Querying the File System

The `Directory` class is a core utility in renoun. This allows you to easily query and render files and directories within a file system. For example, to create a list of blog posts or documentation pages we can query all the MDX files in a directory:

```tsx
import { Directory } from 'renoun/file-system'

const posts = new Directory({
  path: 'posts',
  include: '*.mdx',
})
```

We can then add a loader to the directory that resolves the module of each MDX file using a dynamic import:

```tsx highlightedLines="6-8"
import { Directory } from 'renoun/file-system'

const posts = new Directory({
  path: 'posts',
  include: '*.mdx',
  loaders: {
    mdx: (path) => import(`@/posts/${path}.mdx`),
  },
})
```

<Note>

Ensure that your bundler is configured to handle the file extension you are targeting. For example, Next.js requires [custom configuration](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/mdx) to handle `.mdx` files.

</Note>

Now we can use the configured directory to render the contents of our MDX files by querying them from the file system:

```tsx
import { Directory } from 'renoun/file-system'

const posts = new Directory({
  path: 'posts',
  include: '*.mdx',
  loaders: {
    mdx: (path) => import(`@/posts/${path}.mdx`),
  },
})

export default async function Page({
  params,
}: {
  params: Promise<{ slug: string }>
}) {
  const slug = (await params).slug
  const post = await posts.getFile(slug, 'mdx')
  const Content = await post.getExportValue('default')

  return <Content />
}
```

This will create a collection of all MDX files in the `posts` directory and render them based on the provided slug. Collections are not limited to MDX files and can be used with _any file type_.

### Generating Links

A file system entry's `getPath` method is used to generate a route path for each entry in the directory. For example, to generate a link to each post, you can map over the directory's entries using `getEntries` and then use the entry's `getPath` method to generate a list of links:

```tsx
import { Directory } from 'renoun/file-system'
import Link from 'next/link'

const posts = new Directory({
  path: 'posts',
  include: '*.mdx',
  loaders: {
    mdx: (path) => import(`@/posts/${path}.mdx`),
  },
})

export default async function Page() {
  const allPosts = await posts.getEntries()

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Blog</h1>
      <ul>
        {allPosts.map((post) => {
          const path = post.getPath()

          return (
            <li key={path}>
              <Link href={path}>{post.getTitle()}</Link>
            </li>
          )
        })}
      </ul>
    </>
  )
}
```

<Note>

The `getEntries` method is filtered by the `include` option provided to the `Directory` constructor. This will only return entries that match the provided glob pattern. Alternatively, you can pass a function to `include` to filter entries based on custom logic.

</Note>

## Authoring Content

The renoun toolkit helps with authoring MDX using the `@renoun/mdx` package, allowing you to write content with a mix of Markdown and React components. It is not required, but provides a set of useful defaults.

Here's an example of how you might structure a blog post:

````mdx

title: Build a Button Component in React
date: 2024-03-01
summary: Learn how to build a reusable Button component in React that can be used across your application.
tags:
  - react
  - design systems
---

In modern web development, creating reusable UI components is a must for efficiency and scalability. React, with its component-based architecture, allows developers to build encapsulated components that manage their own state and can be reused throughout applications.

## Building the Button Component

Let's start by creating our Button component:

```tsx
import React from 'react'

export function Button({ label, onClick, className }) {
  return (
    <button className={className} onClick={onClick}>
      {label}
    </button>
  )
}
```
````

## Validating Exports

By using schemas, you can validate module exports and ensure they remain consistent and properly documented. The following is an example of how to validate a module export with renoun using [Zod](https://zod.dev/).

Using our Button component example, we can validate the front matter of the MDX file at the call site of our directory using a schema:

```tsx
import { Directory, withSchema } from 'renoun/file-system'
import { z } from 'zod'

export const posts = new Directory({
  path: 'posts',
  include: '*.mdx',
  loaders: {
    mdx: withSchema(
      {
        frontmatter: {
          title: z.string(),
          date: z.coerce.date(),
          summary: z.string().optional(),
          tags: z.array(z.string()).optional(),
        },
      },
      (path) => import(`@/posts/${path}.mdx`)
    ),
  },
})
```

Here we define a schema for the front matter of our MDX files and use it to validate the front matter of each file in the `posts` directory. This ensures that each file adheres to the schema and provides type safety when accessing the `frontmatter` export.

## Enhancing with Components

The renoun toolkit provides several built-in components to enhance your documentation. For example, you can use the [`APIReference`](/components/api-reference) component to easily document your APIs:

```mdx
import { APIReference } from 'renoun/components'

<APIReference source="components/Card.tsx" />
```

<Preview>
  <APIReference source="components/Card.tsx" />
</Preview>
