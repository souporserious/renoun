This guide will help you configure renoun in your project.

## renoun.json

The `renoun.json` file is used to globally configure components and utilities and override defaults for the entire workspace.

This file should be placed in the root of your workspace. Here is an example configuration:

```json path="renoun.json"
{
  // Provide a schema for the configuration file to enable intellisense
  "$schema": "https://renoun.dev/schema.json",

  // Specify the theme to use for code highlighting
  "theme": "theme.json",

  // Specify the languages to load for code highlighting
  "languages": ["mdx", "typescript", "tsx"],

  // Specify the git information for edit links
  "git": {
    "source": "https://github.com/souporserious/renoun"
  },

  // Specify the site URL for the canonical URL
  "siteUrl": "https://renoun.dev"
}
```

## Themes

Themes are powered by <a href="https://github.com/shikijs/textmate-grammars-themes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shiki</a> and specify how source code is highlighted in the `CodeBlock` and `CodeInline` components. To keep the install size small, renoun does not bundle any themes by default. You can either provide your own local theme JSON file or install the optional `tm-themes` package to load a bundled theme by name.

### TextMate Themes

To use a bundled theme, first install the `tm-themes` package and then reference a <a href="https://shiki.matsu.io/themes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">valid theme by name</a>:

<PackageInstall packages={['tm-themes']} dev />

Now you can reference a theme by name in your `renoun.json` file:

```json
{
  "theme": "nord"
}
```

### Custom Themes

To use a custom theme, you can reference a JSON file that defines a <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/color-theme" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VS Code compatible theme</a>:

```json
{
  "theme": "theme.json"
}
```

### Multiple Themes

You can also specify multiple themes to be used, the first theme will be used as the default theme:

```json
{
  "theme": {
    "light": "vitesse-light",
    "dark": "vitesse-dark"
  }
}
```

This requires using the `ThemeProvider` component that will inject the proper CSS Variables in the head of the document:

```tsx
import { ThemeProvider } from 'renoun'

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode
}) {
  return (
    <html suppressHydrationWarning>
      <body>
        <ThemeProvider>{children}</ThemeProvider>
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

A `data-theme` attribute on the `html` element will be set immediately on page load before the first render based on local storage. This is why we need to suppress hydration warnings since the theme is not known until the React tree is hydrated which could have changed.

To use a specific default theme, append a `data-theme` attribute to the `html` element:

```html
<html data-theme="dark" suppressHydrationWarning>
  ...
</html>
```

The `useThemePicker` hook can be used to build a select menu or toggle for choosing from the configured themes:

```tsx
'use client'
import { useThemePicker } from 'renoun'

export function ThemePicker() {
  const [theme, setTheme] = useThemePicker()

  return (
    <select value={theme} onChange={(event) => setTheme(event.target.value)}>
      <option value="light">Light</option>
      <option value="dark">Dark</option>
    </select>
  )
}
```

### Only Loading Styles

If you are using another theming solution, you can use the `ThemeStyles` component directly to only load the CSS Variables for the theme:

```tsx
import { ThemeStyles } from 'renoun'

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode
}) {
  return (
    <html>
      <body>
        <ThemeStyles />
        {children}
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

This is not required if you are using the `ThemeProvider` component.

### Overriding Themes

To override a theme, you can provide a tuple that specifies the theme values to override:

```json
{
  "theme": {
    "light": "vitesse-light",
    "dark": [
      "vitesse-dark",
      {
        "colors": {
          "editor.background": "#000000",
          "panel.border": "#666666"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

This accepts a subset of a VS Code theme to override, specifically the `colors`, `tokenColors`, and `semanticTokenColors` properties.

## Languages

The `languages` property is used to define the languages that are supported by the `CodeBlock` and `CodeInline` components. This is used to determine which language to load when highlighting code.

### Default Languages

The following languages are loaded by default:

```json
{
  "languages": [
    "css",
    "javascript",
    "jsx",
    "typescript",
    "tsx",
    "markdown",
    "mdx",
    "shellscript",
    "json",
    "html"
  ]
}
```

<Note>

Only this core subset of grammars is bundled with renoun. To add support for additional languages, install the optional `tm-grammars` package and list the languages you want in the `languages` array.

File types such as `js` and `ts` are automatically mapped to the `tsx` grammar, and `md` maps to `mdx`, so they do not need to be included explicitly unless you need features that are only available in the respective grammar.

</Note>

### Additional Languages

To add support for additional languages, install the optional `tm-grammars` package and list the languages you want in the `languages` array.

<PackageInstall packages={['tm-grammars']} dev />

Now you can reference a language by name in your `renoun.json` file:

```json
{
  "languages": ["python", "rust", "go"]
}
```

## Git Information

Git can be used to set the `source`, `branch`, and `provider` of your documentation site. This is used to generate the canonical URL for each page:

```json
{
  "git": {
    "source": "https://github.com/souporserious/renoun",
    "branch": "main",
    "provider": "github"
  }
}
```

## Site URL

The `siteUrl` property is used to define the URL of your documentation site. This is used to generate the canonical URL for each page:

```json
{
  "siteUrl": "https://renoun.dev"
}
```

## Debug Logs

You can enable internal debug logging by setting the `RENOUN_DEBUG` environment variable. This is helpful when investigating issues related to the renoun CLI, the WebSocker server, and other internal utilities.

- Allowed values:
  - `true` or `1`: enable the most verbose logging
  - `error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug`, `trace`: set a specific minimum level
  - `false` or `0`: logging disabled (default)

Examples:

```bash
# Most verbose logging
RENOUN_DEBUG=true renoun next dev

# Only info and above
RENOUN_DEBUG=info renoun next dev
```
