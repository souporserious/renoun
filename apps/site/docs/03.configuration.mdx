This guide will help you configure renoun in your project.

## renoun.json

The `renoun.json` file is used to globally configure components and utilities and override defaults for the entire workspace.

This file should be placed in the root of your workspace. Here is an example configuration:

```json filename="renoun.json"
{
  // Provide a schema for the configuration file to enable intellisense
  "$schema": "https://renoun.dev/schema.json",

  // Specify the theme to use for code highlighting
  "theme": "theme.json",

  // Specify the languages to load for code highlighting
  "languages": ["mdx", "typescript", "tsx"],

  // Specify the git information for edit links
  "git": {
    "source": "https://github.com/souporserious/renoun"
  },

  // Specify the site URL for the canonical URL
  "siteUrl": "https://renoun.dev"
}
```

## Themes

Themes are powered by <a href="https://shiki.style" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shiki</a> and specify how source code is highlighted in the `CodeBlock` and `CodeInline` components. You can use a bundled theme or create your own theme. The default theme is set to `nord`.

### Bundled Themes

To use a bundled theme, you can reference a <a href="https://shiki.matsu.io/themes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">valid theme by name</a>:

```json
{
  "theme": "nord"
}
```

### Custom Themes

To use a custom theme, you can reference a JSON file that defines a <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/color-theme" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VS Code compatible theme</a>:

```json
{
  "theme": "theme.json"
}
```

### Multiple Themes

You can also specify multiple themes to be used, the first theme will be used as the default theme:

```json
{
  "theme": {
    "light": "vitesse-light",
    "dark": "vitesse-dark"
  }
}
```

This requires using the `ThemeProvider` component that will inject the proper CSS Variables in the head of the document:

```tsx
import { ThemeProvider } from 'renoun/components'

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode
}) {
  return (
    <html suppressHydrationWarning>
      <body>
        <ThemeProvider>{children}</ThemeProvider>
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

A `data-theme` attribute on the `html` element will be set immediately on page load before the first render based on local storage. This is why we need to suppress hydration warnings since the theme is not known until the React tree is hydrated which could have changed.

To use a specific default theme, append a `data-theme` attribute to the `html` element:

```html
<html data-theme="dark" suppressHydrationWarning>
  ...
</html>
```

The `useThemePicker` hook can be used to build a select menu or toggle for choosing from the configured themes:

```tsx
'use client'
import { useThemePicker } from 'renoun/components'

export function ThemePicker() {
  const [theme, setTheme] = useThemePicker()

  return (
    <select value={theme} onChange={(event) => setTheme(event.target.value)}>
      <option value="light">Light</option>
      <option value="dark">Dark</option>
    </select>
  )
}
```

### Overriding Themes

To override a theme, you can provide a tuple that specifies the theme values to override:

```json
{
  "theme": {
    "light": "vitesse-light",
    "dark": [
      "vitesse-dark",
      {
        "colors": {
          "editor.background": "#000000",
          "panel.border": "#666666"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

This accepts a subset of a VS Code theme to override, specifically the `colors`, `tokenColors`, and `semanticTokenColors` properties.

## Languages

The `languages` property is used to define the languages that are supported by the `CodeBlock` and `CodeInline` components. This is used to determine which language to load when highlighting code.

The following languages are loaded by default:

```json
{
  "languages": [
    "css",
    "javascript",
    "jsx",
    "typescript",
    "tsx",
    "markdown",
    "mdx",
    "shellscript",
    "json",
    "html"
  ]
}
```

<Note>

Configuring the `languages` property will replace the default languages. If you want to add additional languages, you should include the default languages in your configuration explicitly.

</Note>

## Git Information

Git can be used to set the `source`, `branch`, and `provider` of your documentation site. This is used to generate the canonical URL for each page:

```json
{
  "git": {
    "source": "https://github.com/souporserious/renoun",
    "branch": "main",
    "provider": "github"
  }
}
```

## Site URL

The `siteUrl` property is used to define the URL of your documentation site. This is used to generate the canonical URL for each page:

```json
{
  "siteUrl": "https://renoun.dev"
}
```
