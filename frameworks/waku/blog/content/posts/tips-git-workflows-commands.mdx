Git is the backbone of modern software development. Whether you're working solo or with a team, mastering these Git workflows and commands will significantly improve your development process.

## Essential Git Commands

### 1. Interactive Staging with `git add -p`

Review and stage changes in chunks:

```bash
git add -p filename.js
```

This allows you to:
- Stage specific hunks of changes
- Split large changes into logical commits
- Review each change before staging

### 2. Powerful Commit Search

Find commits by various criteria:

```bash
# Search commit messages
git log --grep="bug fix"

# Search by author
git log --author="John Doe"

# Search by file changes
git log -p -- filename.js

# Search code content in history
git log -S "function searchTerm" --source --all
```

### 3. Interactive Rebase for Clean History

Clean up commit history before pushing:

```bash
git rebase -i HEAD~3
```

Options during interactive rebase:
- `pick` - keep the commit
- `reword` - change commit message
- `squash` - combine with previous commit
- `drop` - remove the commit

## Advanced Git Workflows

### Feature Branch Workflow

```bash
# Start new feature
git checkout -b feature/user-authentication
git push -u origin feature/user-authentication

# Work on feature with regular commits
git add .
git commit -m "Add login form validation"

# Keep feature branch updated
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout feature/user-authentication
git rebase main

# Submit for review
git push origin feature/user-authentication
```

### Git Flow for Release Management

```bash
# Initialize git flow
git flow init

# Start new feature
git flow feature start user-profile

# Finish feature (merges to develop)
git flow feature finish user-profile

# Start release
git flow release start v1.2.0

# Finish release (merges to main and develop)
git flow release finish v1.2.0

# Hotfix for production
git flow hotfix start critical-bug
git flow hotfix finish critical-bug
```

## Useful Git Aliases

Add these to your `~/.gitconfig`:

```ini
[alias]
    # Short status
    st = status -s
    
    # Pretty log
    lg = log --oneline --decorate --graph --all
    
    # Last commit
    last = log -1 HEAD --stat
    
    # Unstage files
    unstage = reset HEAD --
    
    # Show branches
    br = branch -a
    
    # Quick commit
    cm = commit -m
    
    # Amend last commit
    amend = commit --amend --no-edit
    
    # Show current branch
    current = branch --show-current
    
    # Delete merged branches
    cleanup = "!git branch --merged | grep -v '\\*\\|main\\|develop' | xargs -n 1 git branch -d"
```

## Handling Common Scenarios

### Fixing the Last Commit

```bash
# Change last commit message
git commit --amend -m "New commit message"

# Add files to last commit
git add forgotten-file.js
git commit --amend --no-edit

# Completely redo last commit
git reset --soft HEAD~1
# Make new changes
git commit -m "Better commit message"
```

### Working with Stashes

```bash
# Stash current changes
git stash push -m "Work in progress on feature X"

# List stashes
git stash list

# Apply stash without removing it
git stash apply stash@{0}

# Apply and remove stash
git stash pop

# Stash including untracked files
git stash -u

# Create branch from stash
git stash branch feature-branch stash@{1}
```

### Resolving Merge Conflicts

```bash
# Start merge
git merge feature-branch

# View conflict status
git status

# Use merge tool
git mergetool

# After resolving conflicts
git add resolved-file.js
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts"

# Abort merge if needed
git merge --abort
```

## Branch Management Best Practices

### Naming Conventions

```bash
# Features
feature/user-authentication
feature/shopping-cart

# Bug fixes
bugfix/login-error
bugfix/payment-validation

# Hotfixes
hotfix/security-patch
hotfix/critical-bug

# Releases
release/v1.2.0
release/2024-q1
```

### Clean Branch Strategy

```bash
# Delete local branch
git branch -d feature/completed-feature

# Delete remote branch
git push origin --delete feature/completed-feature

# Prune remote tracking branches
git remote prune origin

# Force delete unmerged branch (use carefully!)
git branch -D feature/abandoned-feature
```

## Git Hooks for Automation

### Pre-commit Hook Example

```bash
#!/bin/sh
# .git/hooks/pre-commit

# Run linter
npm run lint
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "Linting failed. Please fix errors before committing."
    exit 1
fi

# Run tests
npm test
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "Tests failed. Please fix failing tests before committing."
    exit 1
fi
```

### Commit Message Validation

```bash
#!/bin/sh
# .git/hooks/commit-msg

commit_regex='^(feat|fix|docs|style|refactor|test|chore)(\(.+\))?: .{1,50}'

if ! grep -qE "$commit_regex" "$1"; then
    echo "Invalid commit message format!"
    echo "Format: type(scope): description"
    echo "Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore"
    exit 1
fi
```

## Pro Tips

1. **Use `.gitignore` templates**: GitHub provides excellent templates for different languages and frameworks.

2. **Sign your commits**: Use GPG signing for verified commits:
   ```bash
   git config --global commit.gpgsign true
   ```

3. **Use conventional commits**: Follow the conventional commit format for better changelog generation.

4. **Backup important branches**: Create backup branches before risky operations:
   ```bash
   git branch backup/feature-before-rebase
   ```

5. **Use `git bisect` for debugging**: Binary search through commit history to find bugs:
   ```bash
   git bisect start
   git bisect bad          # Current commit is bad
   git bisect good v1.0    # v1.0 is known good
   ```

## Conclusion

Mastering Git workflows and commands takes practice, but the investment pays off in improved productivity and collaboration. Start with the basics, gradually incorporate advanced techniques, and establish consistent workflows that work for your team.
