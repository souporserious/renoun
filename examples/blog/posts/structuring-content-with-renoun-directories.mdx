Once a blog grows past a handful of articles, keeping everything organized is harder than it looks.
renoun's directory primitives let you describe how content should be loaded, validated, and sorted in
one place.

## Start with clear directories

Group related content into directories that mirror the reading experience you want. Posts live in
`posts`, podcast notes might sit in `podcasts`, and long-form tutorials can have their own folder.
Each directory can define its own schema, sort order, and loader.

```ts
import { Directory } from 'renoun'
import { z } from 'zod'

const tutorials = new Directory({
  path: 'tutorials',
  filter: '*.mdx',
  schema: {
    mdx: {
      frontmatter: z.object({
        title: z.string(),
        date: z.coerce.date(),
        duration: z.string(),
      }),
    },
  },
  loader: {
    mdx: (path) => import(`./tutorials/${path}.mdx`),
  },
})
```

Typed collections make it clear which metadata is available and prevent a pile of defensive checks in
your UI components.

## Add new content without wiring

When you drop a new file into the directory, renoun picks it up automatically. You can focus on the
writing while the directory handles validation and sorting.
