Welcome to the renoun application example! This post ships with the project rather than the
`@renoun/blog` application, demonstrating how shadowing lets you control your content without copying the
entire example.

```tsx path="posts/hello-world.mdx"
export const metadata = {
  hero: {
    tagline: 'Shadowed content rendered by renoun',
  },
}
```

Shadowing works for any path inside the application. Add more files to the `posts/` directory or create
new components under `ui/` to make the experience your own.
