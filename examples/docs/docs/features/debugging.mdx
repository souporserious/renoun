## Best Practices

- Use conditional breakpoints for complex scenarios to avoid unnecessary stops
- Leverage watch expressions for real-time monitoring of critical values
- Profile performance early in development to catch issues before they become problems
- Keep debugging sessions focused and organized for efficient problem solving
- Use the debugging toolbar for quick access to common debugging actions
- Take advantage of hot reload during debugging to test fixes quickly
