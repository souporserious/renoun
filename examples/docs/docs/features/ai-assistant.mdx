Our AI Assistant is designed to help you write, understand, and debug code more efficiently. It combines the power of large language models with deep code understanding to provide context-aware assistance.

## Overview

The AI Assistant is your intelligent coding companion, available through the command palette (`Cmd/Ctrl + K`) or by typing `/` in the editor. It helps you write better code, understand complex logic, and solve problems faster.
