Our AI Assistant is designed to help you write, understand, and debug code more efficiently. It combines the power of large language models with deep code understanding to provide context-aware assistance.

## Key Features

- **Code Generation**: Generate code snippets and complete functions based on natural language descriptions
- **Code Explanation**: Get detailed explanations of complex code blocks
- **Bug Detection**: Identify potential issues and suggest fixes
- **Refactoring**: Get suggestions for improving code quality and maintainability

## Usage

The AI Assistant is available through the command palette (`Cmd/Ctrl + K`) or by typing `/` in the editor. You can:

1. Ask questions about your code
2. Request code generation
3. Get explanations of complex logic
4. Debug issues with detailed error analysis

## Best Practices

- Be specific in your requests
- Provide context when asking about code
- Use the assistant for learning and understanding, not just code generation
- Review generated code before implementing it
