Navigate through your codebase with ease using our powerful code navigation features. Find definitions, references, and implementations quickly with semantic search and intelligent indexing.

## Features

### Semantic Search

- Search across your entire codebase using natural language
- Find relevant code based on functionality rather than just text
- Filter results by file type, directory, or code context

### Go to Definition

- Jump directly to function and variable definitions
- View implementation details with a single click
- Navigate through complex inheritance chains

### Find References

- Locate all usages of a function, variable, or type
- Track down where specific code patterns are used
- Understand the impact of changes before making them

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- `Cmd/Ctrl + Click`: Go to definition
- `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + F`: Search in files
- `Cmd/Ctrl + P`: Quick file navigation
- `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + O`: Symbol search

## Tips

- Use semantic search for complex queries
- Leverage the reference finder for impact analysis
- Combine navigation features for efficient code exploration
